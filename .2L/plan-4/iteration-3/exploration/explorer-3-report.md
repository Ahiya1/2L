# Iteration Explorer 3: Complexity & Integration

## Note
Comprehensive complexity analysis available in master exploration reports.
See: .2L/plan-4/master-exploration/master-explorer-1-report.md

## Key Points for Iteration 1
- HIGH complexity: 20-22 files, web harvesting, examples
- Estimated 9-11 hours total
- Critical: web harvesting quality (foundation for all)
- Agent prompt update: <50 tokens for 2l-explorer.md
- Risk: incomplete harvest, code example errors

Refer to master exploration for detailed complexity breakdown and builder task recommendations.
